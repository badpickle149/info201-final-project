# Which School is Right For You?

This is a Shiny app
([published here](https://ann-ss.shinyapps.io/info201-final-project/))
that breaks down the financial costs and benefits of different
colleges in the USA. 

CSV files containing various information about colleges are from the U.S.
Department of Education College Scorecard. (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)
The app is designed to help evaluate colleges based on the school's financial cost 
and benefit, both through showing the user relevant statistics and generating a 
calculated value for each school's return on investment.
