# Which School is Right For You?

This is a Shiny app
([published here](https://ann-ss.shinyapps.io/info201-final-project/))
that breaks down the financial costs and benefits of different
colleges in the USA. 

CSV files containing various information about U.S. colleges are used to 
help users learn information about selected schools. The app is designed to 
help evaluate colleges based on the school's financial cost and benefit, 
both through showing the user relevant statistics and comparing two schools 
as well as generating a calculated value for each school's return on investment.
